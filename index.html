      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        A young man commited to bringing value to his own life as well as
        others.
      </p>
      <h1>Where are you from?</h1>
      <p>
        Florida. Born & Raised before I moved out to the surprisingly beautiful
        city of Tucson, Arizona.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
        Trying to make money. But seriously, gaming and reading while finding
        fun stuff do with strangers I've met on the internet. Not as dangerous
        as it sounds, I promise.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>
        Not having a job but something that pays me while I sleep, and I believe
        coding can do that for me.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Tucson, Arizona</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        To create something that has other people visibly light up their face
        and say, "woah, this guy can make a pretty neat website!". To create
        something I'm proud of for people that need it and have the end result
        being them walking away with me improving their business, and them
        improving my wallet size. The biggest thing is the sense of
        accomplishment, though.
